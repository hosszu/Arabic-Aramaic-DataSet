# Arabic-Aramaic-DataSet
The taxa are the followings: Arabic-early, Arabic-Kufic, Arabic-Naskh, Arabic-Mauritanian, Arabic-African, Arabic-modern, 
Nabataean, Palmyrene, Syriac-Estrangela and Syriac-Nestorian. The examined taxa features are extracted based on 
the collections of similar features of the script variants. These collections are called Similarity Features Groups (SFGs), 
and the purpose of their construction is to avoid the random coincidence of evolutionary unrelated but similar features (Hosszú, 2017: 182). 
The outgroup taxon is supposed to be the common ancestor of the ingroup. In our case, the studied script varieties of the Aramaic script family form the ingroup.
